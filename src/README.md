#### quadratic-congruence.asm
- User is prompted to give three integers: a, b, and c. The program then uses the parameters to compute for a value x <= c, such that x^2 is congruent to a (mod) b. This brute force implementation is only viable for integers of relatively small magnitude.

#### capitalize.asm
- Given a hardcoded string, capitalize all lower-case letters, and store each character back into the original string's address. Output both the original and capitalized strings. While-loop implementation of MIPS.
